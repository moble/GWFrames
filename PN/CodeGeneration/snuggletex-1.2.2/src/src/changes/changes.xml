    <release version="1.2.2" date="2010-05-24" description="Version 1.2.2 (SVN revision 584)">
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2010-05-24">
        Updated to JEuclid 3.1.9
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-05-21">
        The UpConversionExampleFragmentServlet now detects and deals with double-encoded
        query strings, which I was finding from certain search engines.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2010-05-21">
        Added a trivial CommandLineRunner class to the samples package, which lets you run
        SnuggleTeX from the command line, giving access to most (but not all) XML and web output
        options. The snuggletex-core.jar now has this listed as its Main-Class, so the JAR can now
        be executed directly.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2010-05-21">
        Added a couple of new overloaded versions of SnuggleSession.writeWebPage() that
        let you specify what should be done with the OutputStream once the content has
        been written. Previously the stream was automatically closed; you can now choose
        between closing it, flushing it or doing nothing.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-05-21">
        Fixed bug in the Content MathML to Maxima XSLT that was causing tunnel
        parameters not to be passed on in certain cases. This appears to have been
        quite obscure as I've never seen it before. Added an additional regression test
        for future.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-05-21">
        Handling of the XHTML serialisation method and the usingNamedEntities
        output property was not working as advertised when there was no XSLT
        2.0 processor available. Instead of failing, SnuggleTeX now silently
        downgrades XHTML output to XML and ignores usingNamedEntities when running
        on XSLT 1.0.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2010-05-21">
        Changed system for XHTML + MathML back to identifiers to the value it had before 1.2.0,
        at the advice of the validator, which seems to have changed behaviour again!
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-05-20">
        Added an expansionLimit property to the SessionConfiguration class that specifies
        how deep to go when expanding out user-defined commands and environments. This
        provides simple protection against possible infinite recursion, which can arise
        in a number of ways and is not easy to test for due to the highly dynamic nature
        of LaTeX input. There is a new error code for this - TTEU00. This subsumes the
        role of the previous TTEUE4 error code, which has been removed.
        <fixes issue="2998211"/>
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-05-19">
        Fixed minor bug that caused certain verbatim-related error messages not to be included
        in the resulting DOM (when generated in this way).
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-05-19">
        User-defined commands and environments now have their #n references checked to make sure
        they're in the correct range. This makes detection of this issue happen at definition time,
        rather than evaluation time. New error codes TTEUCA, TTEUE5 and TTEUE6 are used to flag
        these issues.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-05-19">
        Tidied up code that substitutes arguments into user-defined commands/environments,
        so that \#n is now correctly handled.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2010-04-30">
        Updated the ASCIIMathML input and up-conversion demo to use the final version
        of all of the code from MathAssessEngine. Also added in a real-time preview
        of the resulting source MathML, and fixed a couple of minor bugs.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2010-04-26">
        Improved structure of full ZIP bundle
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-04-22">
        Added support for \not|, which continues through to generation of Content MathML
        <fixes issue="2807101"/>
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-04-20">
        Minor fix to the output of the Math Input demo
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-04-20">
        Renamed *_en.properties as *.properties so as to avoid startup Exception in non-EN locales.
        This was a silly error on my behalf. Thanks to Konstantin Rybakov for pointing this out.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-04-12">
        Fixed output of \neq, which was previously generating a "not in"
        character. Thanks to Konstantin Rybakov for pointing out this silly
        mistake!
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.1" date="2010-04-02" description="Version 1.2.1 (SVN revision 545)">
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2010-03-24">
        Added 'applyingFirefox3SemanticsWorkaround' property to
        DOMOutputOptions that wraps annotated MathML inside an additional
        &lt;mstyle> wrapper to work around rendering issues in Firefox 3.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-03-24">
        Fixed minor issue with the handling of whitespace at the start and end of
        Text tokens in MATH mode.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-03-24">
        Fixed the output of Math styling constructs like \textrm{} so that an empty &lt;mrow/>
        is generated instead of an empty &lt;mstyle/>, as the latter is not valid.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-03-24">
        Line endings in input are now normalised to a single newline when building XML outputs.
        This prevent extraneous carriage returns appearing in some situations when running
        on Windows.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-03-24">
        The content of \textrm{...} and friends is now correctly parsed in LR
        mode, instead of PARAGRAPH mode.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-03-19">
        Fixed unbelievably silly reversed logic that would try to use an XSLT 2.0 processor when
        asking for an XSLT 1.0 processor, and vice versa. This would have prevented
        the examples from working.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.0" date="2010-02-04" description="Version 1.2.0 (SVN revision 533)">
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-02-04">
        Error Tokens recorded due to using environments in an incorrect mode were
        being lost, even though the errors themselves were being recorded correctly.
        This is now fixed.
        <fixes issue="2945869"/>
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2010-01-08">
        Tidied up the ASCIIMathML input demo a bit so that the JavaScript helper code can be
        more easily reused by people. (Also cut down ASCIIMathML.js to remove the optional
        extra stuff included inside it, such as LaTeXMathML.js and ASCIIsvg.js.)
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2010-01-06">
        Fixed bug in handling of \verb and \verb* when the ending delimiter is not found.
        <fixes issue="2926914"/>
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.0-beta1" date="2009-11-26" description="Version 1.2.0-beta1 (SVN revision 518)">
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-11-24">
        Added ErrorGroup interface and implementations to group related ErrorCodes together.
        Error Codes documentation page updated to use this concept.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-11-23">
        Added support for $f^{-1}$ and $f^2$ in Content MathML to Maxima up-conversion stylesheet.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-11-13">
        WebPageOutputOptionsTemplates now sets content type correctly when generating MOZILLA pages.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-10-30">
        Web page builder now always adds xml:lang attribute when generating XHTML or XML outputs.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-10-30">
        Changed public/system identifiers to -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN
        and http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/dtd/xhtml-math11-f.dtd when generating web pages
        of type CROSS_BROWSER_XHTML.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-10-30">
        SnuggleTeX was incorrectly creating 'accent' attributes instead of 'accentunder'
        attributes when creating munder elements.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-08-03">
        Extracted the parts of XMLStringOutputOptions pertaining to XML serialization to an
        interface called SerializationOptions, with a "standalone" implementation that
        replaces and simplifies the various overloaded serialization methods in MathMLUtilities
        and friends. Most of these existing methods have been kept for the time being, but
        marked as deprecated. Also did some further tidying to StylesheetManager, moving some
        code previously in XMLUtilities here where it can be more easily managed.
        Finally, the demo webapp now outputs named entities in MathML source
        fragments, which is more useful for demonstration purposes.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-08-03">
        Fixed overly permissive handling of extraneous '$' characters when parsing math mode.
        <fixes issue="2831470"/>
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-07-27">
        Fixed the Unicode characters emitted within the resulting MathML for
        \cdot, \bullet, \diamond and \frown.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-27">
        Added TransformerFactoryChooser interface that allows users with exacting requirements
        to control the choice of XSLT 1.0 (and 2.0, where required) processors. A default
        implementation is provided that uses the standard JAXP TransformerFactoryImpl search,
        and there's also one which picks Saxon 9.X in all circumstances.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-07-21">
        Improved the mechanism for adding custom built-in commands and environments.
        The old DefinitionMap has been renamed as SnugglePackage and moved to top package.
        Each SnugglePackage can have its own error codes and message bundles.
        A "core" package now provides the functionality for the core module, and the
        old ErrorCode enumeration has been split into an interface of the same name and
        a CoreErrorCodes enumeration. The up-conversion functionality and error codes have
        been moved into a separate package, which can be accessed via the
        UpConversionPackageDefinitions class.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-07-17">
        W3C-related constants have been moved out of the Globals class and now use
        either the standard XMLConstants or new W3CContants classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-17">
        Added first cut of new \assume command that will be used to control aspects of
        the up-conversion process.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-17">
        Enhanced DOMOutputOptions to allow caller to specify whether to use
        namespace prefixes for XHTML and SnuggleTeX XML elements.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-16">
        Added very simple mechanism for getting and setting variables, which will
        be used for "assume" functionality to make up-conversion more customisable.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-07-15">
        Renamed SnuggleSession.getCommandByTeXName() as getBuiltinCommandByTeXName(), and
        similarly the version for environments. These methods are likely to have been used by
        very few people.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-15">
        Added new XMLStringOutputOptions Object, sitting between DOMOutputOptions and WebPageOutputOptions.
        New versions of SnuggleSession.buildXMLString() have been added to reflect this; the existing
        ones are now deprecated and will be removed at the next major release.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-03">
        Math Input Demo now shows both MathML rendering and XHTML+CSS/image renderings
        of the results, which might be useful for comparison purposes.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Added support for the AMS-LaTeX cases, matrix, pmatrix, bmatrix, Bmatrix, vmatrix and Vmatrix environments.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-07-02">
        Up-conversion process now generates MathML using the same namespace prefix
        as the original Presentation MathML produced by SnuggleTeX.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Changed the characters for left and right angle brackets to U+2329 and U+232A
        respectively.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Added missing support for '\left.' and '\right.'
        <fixes issue="2814534"/>
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Internal refactoring of the Interpretation class hierarchy, to make it easier for
        commands and tokens to have multiple meanings. The old MathMLOperator enumeration
        has been replaced with a more general set of constants defining various MathML symbols.
        (Note that if you have been defining your own BuiltinCommand and BuiltinEnvironment
        instances, then you will need to change them slightly. The vast majority of users will
        not have been doing this as the process is not documented - contact me for help if this
        is not the case for you and you can't work out what to do!)
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-06-25">
        Up-conversion process now includes an XPath expression within the <![CDATA[<s:fail/>]]>
        element to help locate where the failure occurred.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-06-23">
        Filled in gap in support for optional arguments in user-defined commands and
        environments.
        <fixes issue="2810332"/>
      </action>

      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-06-19">
        Improved structure of the "full" distribution bundle, also fixing a couple of issues
        with the way Maven was assembling it.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-06-19">
        Renamed UCExxx and UMExxx error codes as UCFxxx and UMFxxx respectively, to
        reflect the fact that they are not handled as errors in the normal way.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-06-19">
